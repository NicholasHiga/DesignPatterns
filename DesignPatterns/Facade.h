// The facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
// in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the 
// subsystem easier to use.

// This is a pretty "common sense" design pattern. So not going to put any code
// here. Pretty much any code library would be an example of this pattern.
